# ttgo_twatch_2020_metronome

Standalone firmware for twatch 2020v1 (not an "app" for sharandac's firmware)

(Probably could be adopted for 2020v3 as well, as it has audio and motor as well, but I do not have it.  v2 will not do it, it lacks required hardware)

Can provide vibro pulses or play mp3 for metronome clicks or do both.
Turns off after 15 seconds if metronome is not playing, otherwise turns off the screen.

ToDo:

1) Tap tempo feature
2) Show battery status
3) Multiple click sounds to choose from.
